    "rationale": "Correct \nCorrect Answer(s): Personal access tokens (PATs) in Azure DevOps\nThe CORRECT answer is to use personal access tokens (PATs) in Azure DevOps. We have two purposes to fulfill:\nThe first is to ensure that the authentication happens from Git which rules out the use of Azure Active Directory based authentication.\nThe second is to minimize the need to provide credentials during an authentication request, for which PAT authentication gives you access without using a username and password directly. There is also an option to use the Git credential Manager tool which needs MS account or Azure AD credentials for the first time when you connect to a Git repo from the Git client. Once authentication is done, the manager will create and cache PAT for future connections until the token expires.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/authentication-guidance?view=azure-devops\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/set-up-credential-managers\nUsing Personal Access token in Azure DevOps:\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/set-up-credential-managers\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/auth-overview\n\nAlternate credentials in Azure DevOps is the INCORRECT option because even if the authentication will work from Git, it wont satisfy the requirement to minimize the need to provide credentials for authentication. Moreover, using alternate credentials is not a secure method, and therefore, it will be deprecated soon in the future.\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/azure-devops-will-no-longer-support-alternate-credentials-authentication/\nManaged identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the INCORRECT option because the authentication method is using Azure Active Directory and not from Git.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview\nUser accounts in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)  are also INCORRECT because it is based on Azure AD authentication and not Git.
